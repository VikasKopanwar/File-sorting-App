# File-sorting-App
In this project, I used Python and the OS library to create a custom sorting solution for efficiently organizing files into folders based on their extension. By leveraging the OS library's functions for interacting with the operating system, I automated the file sorting process, saving time and effort for users dealing with large numbers of files.
